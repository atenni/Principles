# Embrace reality and deal with it

## Be a hyperrealist

Dreams + reality + determination = a successful life.

## Truth – or, more precisely, an accurate undertanding of reality – is the essential foundation for any good outcome

## Be radically open–minded and redically transparent

* Radical open–mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change.
* Don't let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.
* Embracing radical truth and radical transparemcy  will bring more meaningful work and more meaningful realationships.

## Look to nature to learn how reality works

* Don't get hung up on your views of how things "should" be because you will miss out on learning how they really are.
* To be "good" something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded.
* Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything.
* Evolve or die.
