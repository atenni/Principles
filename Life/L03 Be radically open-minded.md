Be radically open–minded
========================


## Recognise your two barriers

* Understand your ego barrier.
* Your two "yous" fight to control you. (See Kahneman's _Thinking fast and
  slow_.)
* Understand your blind spot barrier.


## Practice radical open–mindedness

* Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and
  recognise that your ability to deal well with "not knowing" is more important
  than whatever it is you do know.
* Recognise that decision making is a two-step process: First take in all the
  relevant information, then decide.
* Don't worry about looking good; worry about achieving your goal.
* Realise that you can't put out without taking in.
* Recognise that to gain the perspective that comes from seeing things through
  another's eyes, you must suspend judgment for a time—only by empathising can
  you properly evaluate another point of view. 
* Remember that you're looking for the best answer, not simply the best answer
  that you can come up with yourself.
* Be clear on whether you are arguing or seeking to understand, and think about
  which is most appropriate based on your and others' believability.\


## Appreciate the art of thoughtful disagreement


## Triangulate your view with believable people who are willing to disagree

* Plan for the worst–case scenario to make it as good as possible.


## Recognise the signs of closed–mindedness and open–mindedness that you should watch out for


## Understand how you can become radically open–minded

* Regularly use pain as your guide towards quality reflection.
* Make being open–minded a habit.
* Get to know your blind spots.
* If a number of different believable people say you are doing something wrong
  and you are the only one who doesn't see it that way, assume that you are
  probably biased.
* Meditate.
* Be evidenced–based and encourage other to be the same.
* Do everything in your power to help others also be open–minded.
* Use evidence–based decision–making tools.
* Know when it's best to stop fighting and have faith in your decision–making
  process.
