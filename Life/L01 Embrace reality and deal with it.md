# Embrace reality and deal with it

## Be a hyperrealist

Dreams + reality + determination = a successful life.

## Truth – or, more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality – is the essential foundation for any good outcome

## Be radically open–minded and radically transparent

* Radical open–mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid
  learning and effective change.
* Don't let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.
* Embracing radical truth and radical transparency  will bring more meaningful
  work and more meaningful relationships.

## Look to nature to learn how reality works

* Don't get hung up on your views of how things "should" be because you will
  miss out on learning how they really are.
* To be "good" something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and
  contribute to evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded.
* Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing
  that is permanent and it drives everything.
* Evolve or die.

## Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward

* The individual's incentives must be aligned with the group's goals.
* Reality is optimising for the whole – not for you.
* Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable.
* Realise that you are simultaneously everything and nothing – and decide what
  you want to be.
* What you will be will depend on the perspective you have.

## Understand nature's practical lessons

* Maximise your evolution.
* Remember "no pain, no gain".
* It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength on has to
  push one's limits, which is painful.

## Pain + reflection = progress

* Go to the pain rather than avoid it.
* Embrace tough love.

## Weigh second– and third–order consequences

## Own your outcomes

## Look at the machine from the higher level

* Think of yourself as a machine operating within a machine and know that you
  have the ability to alter your machines to produce better outcomes.
* By comparing your outcomes with your goals, you can determine how to modify
  your machine.
* Distinguish between you as the designer of your machine and you as a worker
  with your machine.
* The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others
  objectively, which leans them to bump into their own and others' weaknesses
  again and again.
* Successful people are those who can go above themselves to see things
  objectively and manage those things to shape change.
* Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a
  great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you
  develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be
  doing.
* Because it is difficult to see oneself objectively, you need to rely on the
  input of others and the whole body of evidence.
* If you are open–minded enough and determined, you can get virtually anything
  you want.
