# Use the 5 step process to get what you want out of life

## Have clean goals

* Prioritise: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have everything you want.
* Don't confuse goals with desires.
* Decide what you really want in life by reconciling your goals and your desires.
* Don't mistake the trappings of success for success itself.
* Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable.
* Remember that great expectations create great capabilities.
* Almost nothing can stop you from succeeding if you have (i) flexibility and (ii) selfâ€“accountability.
* Knowing how to deal well with your setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward.
