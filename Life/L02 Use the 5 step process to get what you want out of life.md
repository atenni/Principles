# Use the 5 step process to get what you want out of life

## Have clean goals

* Prioritise: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have
  everything you want.
* Don't confuse goals with desires.
* Decide what you really want in life by reconciling your goals and your
  desires.
* Don't mistake the trappings of success for success itself.
* Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable.
* Remember that great expectations create great capabilities.
* Almost nothing can stop you from succeeding if you have (i) flexibility and
  (ii) selfâ€“accountability.
* Knowing how to deal well with your setbacks is as important as knowing how to
  move forward.

## Identify and don't tolerate problems

* View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you.
* Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities
  that are unpleasant to look at.
* Be specific in identifying your problems.
* Don't mistake a cause of a problem with the real problem.
* Distinguish big problems from small ones.
* Once you identify a problem, don't tolerate it.

## Diagnose problems to get at their root causes

* Focus on the "what is" before deciding "what to do about it".
* Distinguish proximate cause from root cause.
* Recognise that knowing what someone (including you) is like will tell you
  what you can expect from them.
