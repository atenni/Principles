# Use the 5 step process to get what you want out of life

## 1. Have clear goals

* Prioritise: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have
  everything you want.
* Don't confuse goals with desires.
* Decide what you really want in life by reconciling your goals and your
  desires.
* Don't mistake the trappings of success for success itself.
* Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable.
* Remember that great expectations create great capabilities.
* Almost nothing can stop you from succeeding if you have (i) flexibility and
  (ii) self–accountability.
* Knowing how to deal well with your setbacks is as important as knowing how to
  move forward.

## 2. Identify and don't tolerate problems that stand in the way of you achieving those goals

* View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you.
* Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities
  that are unpleasant to look at.
* Be specific in identifying your problems.
* Don't mistake a cause of a problem with the real problem.
* Distinguish big problems from small ones.
* Once you identify a problem, don't tolerate it.

## 3. Diagnose problems to get at their root causes

* Focus on the "what is" before deciding "what to do about it".
* Distinguish proximate cause from root cause.
* Recognise that knowing what someone (including you) is like will tell you
  what you can expect from them.

## 4. Design a plan

* Go back before you go forward.
* Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine.
* Remember that there are typically many paths to achieving your goals.
* Think of your plan as being like a movie script in that you visualise who
  will do what through time.
* Write down your plan for everyone to see and to measure your progress
  against.
* Recognise that it doesn't take a lot of time to design a good plan.

## 5. Push through to completion

* Great planners who don't execute their plans go nowhere.
* Good work habits are vastly underrated.
* Establish clear metrics to make certain that you are following your plan.

## Remember that weaknesses don't matter if you find solutions

* Look at the patterns of your mistakes and identify at which step in the
  5–Step Process you typically fail.
* Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in the way of their success;
  find yours and deal with it.

## Understand your own and others' mental maps and humility
