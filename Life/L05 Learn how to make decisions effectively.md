Learn how to make decisions effectively
=======================================

## Recognise that 1) the biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions, and 2) decision making is a two–step process (first learning and then deciding)


## Synthesise the situation at hand

* One of the most important decisions you can make is who you ask questions of.
* Don't believe everything you hear.
* Everything looks bigger up close.
* New is overvalued relative to great.
* Don't over–squeeze dots.


## Synthesise the situation through time

* Keep in mind both the rates of change and the levels of things, and the
  relationships between them.
* Be imprecise.
* Remember the 80/20 rule and know what the key 20% is.
* Be an imperfectionist.


## Navigate levels effectively

* Use the terms "above the line" and "below the line" to establish which level
  a conversation is on.
* Remember that decisions need to be made at the appropriate level, but they
  should also be consistent across levels.


## Logic, reason, and common sense are your best tools for synthesising reality and understanding what to do about it


## Prioritise be weighting the value of additional information against the cost of not deciding

* All of your "must–dos" must be above the bar before you do your
  "like–to–dos."
* Chances are you won't have time to deal with the unimportant things, which is
  better than not having time to deal with the important things.
* Don't mistake possibilities for probabilities.


## Simplify!


## Use principles


## Believability weight your decision making


## Convert your principles into algorithms and have the computer make decisions alongside you


## Be cautious about trusting AI without having deep understanding
